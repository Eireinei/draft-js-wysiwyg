# Contributing to Draft-js-wysiwyg 

If you're reading this, you're awesome! Thank you for helping us make this project great and being a part of the Draft-JS-Wysiwyg community. Here are a few guidelines that will help you along the way.

## Code of Conduct

Draft-js-wysiwyg has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it.
Please read [the full text](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Types of contributions üìù
You can contribute to the Draft-js-wysiwyg content and site in several ways.

### üö® Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/romainleduc/draft-js-wysiwyg/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

To learn more about opening a pull request in this repo, see [Opening a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request) below.

## Opening a pull request
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that needs to be tested, you can add it yourself. Otherwise, we'll add the Needs test label to ask for help from other contributors to this    project. This will surely lengthen the merging process.
3. If you have changed the APIs, we would be grateful if you could update the documentation as well.
4. Ensure the test suite passes using the `yarn test` command.
5. Make sure your code lints using the `yarn format` command (and `yarn docs:format` command if you have modified the site doc).
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
